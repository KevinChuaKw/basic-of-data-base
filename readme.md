Accessing the database
Whenever you reopen the gitpod server. There is a need to run this piece of code 'sudo dpkg -i mongosh.deb' in the terminal 

To connect to the mongo database, you will need to use the connection string under database and put the data string into the terminal followed by the passward 'haha123'
You should be seeing "Atlas atlas-fi1sr9-shard-0 [primary]" when you are connected to the database. 

To get the connection string, you will need to go under 'database' then under 'database deployments' and then 'connect' and 'shell' - the connection string will be there
An alternate way to get this is going to go to 'database' and under 'database deplyments' and look for 'drivers'. The connection string is there

mongodb+srv://root:<password>@testing-database-for-ke.m639ryv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

To exit the database key in "control+c" in the terminal

Go to browse collections to see all the sample databases
